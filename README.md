# VIDYUT

Youtube Auto Translator browser extension:

we have developed a solution that can translate youtube cc much better and provide access to global users across the world by  to be automatically dubbing into multiple languages.







Focus Mate:

we have developed a solution called focusmate. Which will hide the recommendations based on the different modes. for example if user switch to study mode it only shows education content in the recommendation.





Idea Spark:

we believe in learn by doing. so we have developed a web application called Idea Spark, that will tackle this problem by giving project suggestion based on their skills so that can implment whatever they have learnt in real time.







Choose your laptop:

There are many laptop models and specifications to choose from, which can be confusing and overwhelming for buyers. Some common mistakes to avoid are buying the cheapest or most expensive laptop, buying a laptop for today instead of tomorrow, ignoring ports and compatibility, and opting for the highest resolution.

Different operating systems have different strengths and weaknesses, and some software may not run on certain platforms. Buyers need to consider their needs and preferences before choosing a laptop with Windows, macOS, Chrome OS, or Linux. To reslove this we have developed an web application that recommends the ideal laptop based on a small quiz. This could save students a great deal of time and effort in choosing the right device for their needs.







Quizzo:

Online exams may not reflect students’ true learning or abilities, as they may rely on copying rather than understanding, applying, or creating knowledge.

To tackle this problem, we are developed an AI-proctored exam that tracks candidates and ensures that they are not cheating. Additionally, we are incorporating features that make it possible for blind, deaf, and mute students to take the exam.
