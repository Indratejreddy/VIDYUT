Choose your laptop:

There are many laptop models and specifications to choose from, which can be confusing and overwhelming for buyers. Some common mistakes to avoid are buying the cheapest or most expensive laptop, buying a laptop for today instead of tomorrow, ignoring ports and compatibility, and opting for the highest resolution.

Different operating systems have different strengths and weaknesses, and some software may not run on certain platforms. Buyers need to consider their needs and preferences before choosing a laptop with Windows, macOS, Chrome OS, or Linux. To reslove this we have developed an web application that recommends the ideal laptop based on a small quiz. This could save students a great deal of time and effort in choosing the right device for their needs.







Quizzo:

Online exams may not reflect studentsâ€™ true learning or abilities, as they may rely on copying rather than understanding, applying, or creating knowledge.

To tackle this problem, we are developed an AI-proctored exam that tracks candidates and ensures that they are not cheating. Additionally, we are incorporating features that make it possible for blind, deaf, and mute students to take the exam.
